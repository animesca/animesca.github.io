<p>Snapchat’s anime filter was used more than 3 billion times in the first week after it was released, snap said today, confirming what we already knew: The filter uses snapchat�s facial recognition technology to pinpoint any faces on camera, then adapts each face to look like a hand drawn or computer animated character. Variety of anime face maker styles are ready to use too! The filter tracks your facial features in real time and is a hit with fans credit: Crop, resize, exposure, blur, sharpen, red eye removal, rgb curves, instagram filters and photo masks.</p>

<p>Apply basic image editing operations and effects: Use the anime effect and choose the desired eye colour. Your eye shape and facial expressions can also change the face the filter gives you, going from a shounen anime. We are proud to have created ageing and lifestyle software for award winning campaigns and we are always open to new ideas and projects. Crop, resize, exposure, blur, sharpen, red eye removal, rgb curves, instagram filters and photo masks.</p>
