However, the manga does include conversations and situations that do not appear in the anime, so in all honesty, you should read the manga starting from chapter 1. I imagine that we can expect at least an entire volume to reach the very conclusion of the manga.</p>

<p>In the movie format, that’d mean an aot movie that’s over 2 hours. ↑ yuki kaji and yui ishikawa as titans in chapter 81. Aot chapter 134 spoilers, leaks, and raw scans: I highly doubt it will be the last chapter. There have been many discussions, theories, and predictions relating to attack on titan 134.</p>

<p>The biggest difference is that the anime shows the 104th cadets training much later than the manga. See more ideas about manga, shingeki no kyojin, attack on titan. With the 133rd chapter of snk manga, readers are now eagerly looking forward to reading attack on titan chapter 134. That means that if you wanted to pick up right after episode 12, as everyone mentioned above, it would be chapter 51 (volume 13) of the manga. Manga attack on titan raksasa itu bertubuh besar, tidak memiliki intelektual, membenci manusia, dan yang paling buruk… mereka menganggap manusia sebagai makanan.</p>
