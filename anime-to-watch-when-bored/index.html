<p>It’s pretty colourful and fun to watch but there is nothing in the sense of character development, relationships between characters or an overall good and engaging narrative, the ending is also pretty bad too. Anime blew up the western world in the 2010s. (im soo bored) it can be shounen atau shoujo.no yaoi, yuri atau hentai(i hate those).please give the genres as long as it has comedy in it and tearjerking scenes and tough girls.thank you oh yeah, and a picture of the main characters, too. Classics and new stuff included. Hugs or holding hands the most you can see.</p>
