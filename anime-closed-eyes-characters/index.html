<p>According to tv tropes, the physical trait of eyes always shut is commonly. In bug fables, several characters have their eyes always closed, such as chubee, libren, mayor of the defiant root, kina and acolyte aria (though the latter two do open their eyes, the former when her berserk button is pushed, and the latter when fighting). Firstly, we should recognize that anime eyes are large because they can more easily convey emotions than smaller eyes (roger ebert even comments on this in his review for grave of the fireflies).given that anime eyes have this reputation, happy characters closing their eyes focuses the audience�s attention to the characters� assumed, raw emotions (happiness for this case) rather. Male anime eyes are usually smaller and narrower than female anime eyes. You may also notice some blush added to the cheeks.</p>
