<p>It’s a shortcut to identifying a character that’s sometimes use to support characterization, but the connection between hair color and character isn’t as clear as the connection between hairstyle and character. Blue hair might not exist naturally (unless you dye your hair blue or wear a wig), but in anime, the hair color is quite common. See more ideas about female characters, drawings, character design. Miko�s friends at school are assaulted by demons and her professor is kidnapped and sent to their infernal dimension; Richie in recess reindeer has blue hair to match his blue body.</p>
