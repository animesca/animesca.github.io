<p>Nagi no asukara knows how to represent their characters and develop them from poorly written looking characters to stronger and likable ones, but as far as the romance goes it�s focused on romance, unlike many animes where people only fall in love with the one with the biggest. Nagi no asukara knows how to represent their characters and develop them from poorly written looking characters to stronger and likable ones, but as far as the romance goes it�s focused on romance, unlike many animes where people only fall in love with the one with the biggest. Many drama and comedy series make sure to include a romance plot, and for good reason: Anime has a reputation for being kid stuff, because of the connection between animation and kids cartoons in the west. Nagi no asukara is a perfect example of a well written, and good developed anime, both in drama, fantasy and romance.</p>
