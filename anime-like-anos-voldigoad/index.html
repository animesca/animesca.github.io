<p><strong>Anime Like Anos Voldigoad</strong>. If were going to add a character outside of the anime universe then my best pick would be The One Above All. Anos Voldigoad is the main protagonist of the light novel and animemanga series The Misfit of Demon King Academy. Eventually he gets tired of all wars and battles and decides that the only way to achieve peace is to build walls between the four races hoping that they will forget their grudge after a thousand years or more. This animated series is rather short at only 12 episodes but it makes the most of that tight time frame.</p>

<p>Anos Voldigoad アノスヴォルディゴード Anosu Vorudigōdo is the reincarnation of the man who was feared as the Demon King of Tyranny 2000 years ago and is the main protagonist of Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha. However what awaited him in reincarnation after 2000 years were descendants who became too weak after being accustomed to peace and all sorts of magic that deteriorated to the extreme. What did you say. Anos Voldigoad vs Rimuru TempestManga Anime Web Light novel featsBattle to the death. He is a laid-back character but when he has to fight he wields powerful magic strong enough to burn down Dilhaide the entire demon realm. 2000 years ago in his previous life Anos was an orphan.</p>
<h3 id="humans-killed-his-mother-while-she-was-pregnant-with-him-and-he-was-born-from-her-corpse">Humans killed his mother while she was pregnant with him and he was born from her corpse.</h3><p>Humans killed his mother while she was pregnant with him and he was born from her corpse.

Fight takes place in the hidden leaf village. Since he possesses some kind of 99x layers of dimensions that acts as his own existence and his source is nothingness.</p>
