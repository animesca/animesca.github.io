I like all three, especially spirited away, but it hardly shows eclectic taste.some ones worth watching include belladonna of sadness, patlabor, end of evangelion, my neighbor the yamadas, adolescence of utena, metropolis, escaflowne: (how do we rank shows?) rank: Akira still stands as a high watermark. Picking just one hayao miyazaki film for a “best anime movies” list feels like an unfair challenge.</p>

<p>A classic anime action film that seemed to come out of nowhere, sword of the stranger has a simple plot but executes its use of action sequences flawlessly. As this is a list of anime series and shows to watch, no anime movies were considered for this feature. Seriously, this is one of makoto shinkai’s best works and one of the most amazing sad romance anime movies i had seen so far, the story was very realistic and everyone who experienced a similar scenario with the main characters will surely remember their past. So, if you are good at photoshop and have a funny bone, you can check out the photoshop battles subreddit, where a weekly battle for glory is held. Suzu no shizuku follows ginko�s peculiar journey amidst the occult to unravel the mystery behind the enigmatic girl called kaya and the mountain that has become her home.</p>

<li>see my anime mini series list to wrap all movies up. Hunter x hunter (2014) anime. After comparisons, some anime streaming sites stand out. It�s a beautiful film to watch, with tremendous attention to detail, a cool story, and fantastic. (how do we rank shows?) rank:</li>

<p>Hunter x hunter (2014) anime. It�s a great movie, full stop. The anime movies deal with the paranormal and explore mature themes like suicide, rape, patricide, incest, and murder. Akira isn�t only a great anime movie, and it isn�t only great animation, even though it�s both of those. In a world dominated by superhero movies, one punch man is the hero we deserve and the one we need right now.</p>
