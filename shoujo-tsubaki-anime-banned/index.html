I believe the works listed are among the objectively best anime made to date, based either on visuals, atmosphere, rewatchability, characters, storytelling or a combination of those factors. Because it was so bad that japan banned it from their country. The main reason why this anime tends to be so widely hated, and why it was even banned in japan as well as having some of the footage completely destroyed and thus lost forever, is because of just how disturbing it is. It was banned out right in several countries and iirc several anime critics have named it the second worst anime ever made partly on it being so immorally irrepressible, and also partly because it is terrible. The film was considered lost for a while, but a bootleg.</p>
