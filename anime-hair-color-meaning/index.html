<p>Amazon / nobunaga the fool This natural hair color is found in realistic or serious anime. The hair color of a character signifies aspects of their nature and reflects their role in a story. In some cases they express significant elements of that person�s character (based on color symbolism in japan). Aside from the original black and blonde , other people color their hair as a way of defining their personality and expressing a certain degree of love for fashion.</p>

Confident, cheerful, and entirely extroverted, you strive to make many friends and have a lot of fun in life. Blue/green black pink yellow/orange red white metallic purple</p>
